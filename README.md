                                             🌐 Conflict Risk Index (CRI)

📊 Early Detection of Workplace Strain
Conflict Risk Index (CRI) is a data-driven metric that identifies emerging tension, polarization, and instability in workplaces — before conflicts escalate.


------🎯 What It Does

✔ Measures trust, psychological safety, communication health, and engagement

✔ Detects volatility and polarization, not just low satisfaction

✔ Uses aggregated data only — no individual tracking


------🧠 How It Works

CRI combines survey patterns and HR indicators into a single explainable score (0–100) at the department, role, or location level.

CRI = (Engagement Volatility × 0.30)
    + (Trust Decline × 0.25)
    + (Communication Strain × 0.20)
    + (HR Stress Signals × 0.15)
    + (Change Exposure × 0.10)



------🚦 Risk Levels

Score; Meaning; Action

🟢 0–39; Low Risk; Monitor

🟡 40–69; Medium Risk; Preventive attention

🔴 70–100; High Risk; Support intervention


------🔐 Privacy First: 

All data is aggregated.
No personal evaluation. No judgment. Just patterns that matter.



------✨ In One Line: 

CRI is an early-warning system for workplace conflict — focused on prevention, not punishment.
